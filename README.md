# Maze Solver
Maze Solver is a Python-based application designed to solve mazes efficiently using pathfinding algorithms.
## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository_url>
### Navigate to the project directory
cd MazeSolver
### Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
Open the MazeSolver.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Ensure that you have your maze data ready either in a compatible format or as input within the notebook.
Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the maze data, solve the maze, and visualize the solution.
Optionally, you can customize the input maze or experiment with different parameters to observe variations in the solution.
After running all the necessary cells, you should see the solution path visualized, along with relevant metrics such as turn count, traversal distance, and execution time.
### Sample Input
For convenience, sample input images of mazes are provided in the repository ([sample_mazes directory](https://github.com/Hema-Arularasi/Maze-Solver)), along with their corresponding solutions.
### Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to Maze Solver, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. We welcome any contributions that improve the functionality, efficiency, or usability of the program.
